# Check an MD5 hash of the public key to ensure that it matches with what is in a CSR or private key using openssl command

The MD5 hash should match the CERT and the KEY, that means they are correct

# Check MD 5hash of the CERT
openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in certificate.crt | openssl md5
openssl x509  -text -noout -in certificate.crt

# Check MD 5hash of the KEY
openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in privateKey.key | openssl md5
openssl rsa -noout -text -in privateKey.key 

# Check MD 5hash of the CSR
openssl req -noout -modulus -in CSR.csr | openssl md5
openssl req -text -noout -verify -in CSR.csr
