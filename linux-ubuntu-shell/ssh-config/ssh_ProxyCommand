# ssh into the "target" server from "jumpBox"

```
ssh -o "ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p jumpBox-USER@jumpbox-proj.com -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa" target-USER@proj.1app.com -i ~/.ssh/proj-1/proj-1.pem
or 
ssh -o "ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p jumpBox-USER@123.456.240.250  -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa" 1app-USER@123.456.99.30   -i ~/.ssh/proj-1/proj-1.pem
```

This command is the same as the ssh config file:

```
Host jumpbox
  User jumpBox-USER
  HostName jumpbox-proj.com
#  HostName 123.456.240.250
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host target-proj-1app-box
  User 1app-USER
  HostName proj.1app.com
#  HostName 123.456.99.30
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/proj-1/proj-1.pem
  ProxyJump jumpbox # bastion-or-jumpbox-nickname in case "jumpbox"
```

SSH config using IP's for diference devices, with the IPS being added with wild cars just use the cmd: `ssh 1.2.3.4` or `ssh  172.31.16.52` to ssh ito the machine.
```
Host 1.2.3.* 10.50.60.* 172.31.16.*
  User bob.smith
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ProxyJump jumpbox # bastion-or-jumpbox-nickname in case "jumpbox"
```
