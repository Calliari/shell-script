##### Change Linux kernel configuration
There is a dir where various files that can be used to modify the kernel runtime, the basic commaand are;

See the help and what the flags are;
  ```
  sysctl --help
  ```

Check the current config;
  ```
  sysctl -a
  ```

Add/change a new or the current config, for example;
  ```
  sysctl -w vm.overcommit_ratio=100
  #or
  sysctl -w vm.swappiness=45
  ```

These changes are applied immediately but will only persist until the next system reboot.
To have the changes remain permanent, the same parameter values need to be added to sysctl.conf â€“file;
There is a directory at; `/etc/sysctl.d` and a default file at; `sysctl.conf`
  ```
  # All files under the dir will be load and configure the kernel, i.e;
  /etc/sysctl.d/1000-custom.conf
  
  ```

 Or it can be added inot the main default file;
  ```
  vim  /etc/sysctl.conf
  ```

To reload the Linux kernel configuration withou reboot, run;
  ```
  sysctl -p
  ```

Tutoria;
1) Check the swappiness before change
    ```
    cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
    ```

2) Change the swappiness
   ```
   # vim  /etc/sysctl.conf
   vm.swappiness = 44
   ```
3) Reload the configuration after chaneg - (reload systemctl)
   ```
   sysctl -p
   #or
   systemctl daemon-reload
   #or
   sysctl --system

   ```

4) recheck the swappiness after change
   ```
   cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
   ```
